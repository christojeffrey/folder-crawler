# Folder-Crawling-Implementation-with-BFS-DFS-Algorithm
## description
this is a folder crawler--a program to search over a tree datastructure, until the intended file to find is found-- that's made using c# languange on visual studio. the main purpose of this project is to apply our knowledge about BFS and DFS, and explore C# and visual studio. 

## how to install for first-timers (easy way)
1. open bin folder
2. run setup.exe
3. Run `VSProject` (you can find it on your desktop or recently installed apps on Windows)

## how to actually run the program
1. select desired directory (make sure you have run `VSProject.exe` first)
2. input target filename on the textbox
3. select type of algorithm you would lik to choose
4. choose whether you like the program to search for 1 instance only, or all occurences
5. press `search`
6. Wait until the time elapsed on the bottom right shows value, that means the program has completed computing
7. You can see, edit, zoom the output graph
8. You can also open in File Explorer by selecting a path from the listbox and press `open`

## how to run (from source)
1. install visual studio
2. clone or download this repo
3. open visual studio, choose 'open project or solution'
4. go to this repo, find `VSProject.sln`
5. we use MSAGL in this project. here's [a guide to install it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XhFSpHU028Gaf7YxkmdbluLkQgVl3MY6gt1t-PL30LA/edit)
